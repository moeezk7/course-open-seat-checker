# course-open-seat-checker
This is a tool I created that will continually check for an open seat in any planned courses on the Michigan State University schedule builder. I found the built in MSU waitlist to be slow in notifying the user, so I made my own which is much quicker. Once a seat in a course opens, it will notify the user repeatedly until the seat fills again.
